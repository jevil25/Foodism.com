As with the potato filling, you'll have to follow the same two rules with the kheema filling to guarantee that your samosas turn out crispy and not at all soggy. The first, again, is make sure your filling isn't overly wet. To accomplish this, I first cook out much of the water in the ground lamb, and then I add some flour along with the peas to the mixture. The starch in the flour will gelatinize and help to bind any water that remains. The other rule is to make sure that the filling is completely cool when stuffing it into the samosas.\r\n\r\nFor the kheema, while I prefer using lamb, you can also use ground beef, but just make sure it's lean. Using excessively fatty ground meat means a lot of fat will render out of the meat, and you'll either have a greasy filling or will have to drain off a fair amount before cooling the cooked filling.\r\n\r\nRecipe Facts\r\n\r\nPrep:\r\n75 mins\r\nCook:\r\n55 mins\r\nTotal:\r\n2 hrs 10 mins\r\nMakes:\r\n20 samosas\r\nRate & Comment\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\nSave Recipe\r\nFor the Pastry Dough: \r\n2 cups (280g) all-purpose flour, such as King Arthur, plus extra for shaping and rolling out the pastry\r\n1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt\r\n1 teaspoons caraway seeds, lightly cracked (optional)\r\n1/4 cup (60ml) neutral oil, such as grapeseed\r\n1/3 cup plus 3 tablespoons (80ml plus 45ml) chilled water, divided\r\nFor the Lamb Kheema Filling:\r\n2 tablespoons (30ml) ghee or neutral oil such as grapeseed\r\n4 medium garlic cloves (20g), finely grated\r\nOne 2-inch (5cm) piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated\r\n1 teaspoon garam masala\r\n1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric\r\n1/2 teaspoon Kashmiri chile powder (see note)\r\n1 pound (450g) 85% lean ground lamb or beef \r\n1 tablespoon (6g) all-purpose flour\r\n1/2  cup (60g) frozen peas, thawed and drained\r\n1 to 2 fresh green chiles such as serrano or jalapeño, stemmed and finely chopped\r\n1/4 cup (15g) tightly packed chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems\r\n2 tablespoons (30ml) apple cider or malt vinegar\r\nKosher salt\r\nDirections\r\nFor the Pastry Dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine flour, salt, and caraway seeds (if using) and mix by hand to evenly disperse the ingredients.

For a longer rest, it can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours, then brought to cool room temperature, around 70°F (21°C), before use.\r\nRested samosa pastry dough on a work surface\r\nFor the Lamb Kheema Filling: In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds. Add garam masala, turmeric, and chile powder and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds. Add ground meat, and using a wooden spoon, break it into small pieces. Cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up any clumps, until meat is browned, and most of the liquid it released has evaporated, 10 to 12 minutes."",""Reduce heat to low, add peas, sprinkle flour over meat mixture, and stir to combine. Remove from heat, then add chiles, cilantro, and vinegar. Season with salt to taste, and drain off any excess fat. If making samosas right away, let filling cool to room temperature, between 68°F and 77°F (20°C to 25°C), before using. Alternatively, transfer filling to an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to use. Allow to come to room temperature before stuffing into dough."",""For Filling, Frying and Serving the Samosas: Divide dough into 10 equal portions by weight, and shape each into a ball over a cool and dry surface using minimal flour. If the kitchen is warm, read up on our hot-weather baking tips to ensure no problems with the dough. Transfer dough balls to a lightly floured baking sheet and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Fill a small bowl with water."",""Working with one ball of dough at a time, roll out dough to form a 7-inch (17cm) circle. Using a sharp knife, cut the circle in half; return to the baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough balls."",""Working with one semicircle at a time, wet a fingertip in the bowl of water and dab halfway down the straight edge, and then fold the wet end over the dry side, pressing gently to seal. This will form a triangular pocket. Hold the pocket open like a little waffle cone, and gently spoon in 40g (about 3 tablespoons) kheema filling. Dab the tip of a finger in water and moisten the inner flap of dough, then fold it over the filling, and press gently to seal it against the dough on the other side, then gently pinch each corner of the samosa to ensure all three points are well sealed."",""Skim any browned bits from oil and discard.

Delicate and flavorful, these raspberry rosewater cupcakes make a lovely treat for an afternoon tea.

Raspberry Rosewater Cupcakes
I love the delicate floral perfume of rosewater. Used in baking, it gives a slightly oriental touch to your cakes, which always surprises at first as we do not use it so often. This is why the use of rosewater always makes its little effect when you really want to surprise your guest taste buds. One of the recipe I’m the most proud of this year is my Ispahan Style Pavlova with Rosewater and Raspberry. This dessert is very surprising in taste and texture and looks absolutely adorable.

Return the meat and all its resting juices back to the pot, and add the onion, kielbasa, prunes, cabbage, and the sauerkraut and bacon mixture, along with its cooking water.

You’ll of course need utensils, but the fun of it is to shovel the bigos and its juices on to the bread. Bigos lasts forever, and gets better with time.
